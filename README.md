# MENLO
We're doing research for a potential new business idea. Thank you to everyone who is contributing to our journey
Currently, we're mostly learning from potential customers and users. And iterating on our investment thesis
We aren't building yet

Our priority is to discover a business idea which is truly mission driven
And which will enable us to work with people we truly enjoy spending time with
Being venture scale is a goal. But less important

It's still extremely early days
Everything is up for discussion and likely to change

Again, thank you to everyone who has helped so far
And feel free to reach out with any ideas, comments or pushback
