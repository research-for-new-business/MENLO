# MENLO
We're doing research for a potential new business idea. Thank you to everyone who is contributing to our journey.
Currently, we're mostly learning from potential customers and users. And iterating on our investment thesis.
We aren't building yet. And everything is up for discussion.

Our priority is to discover a business idea which is truly mission driven.
And which will enable us to work with people we truly enjoy spending time with.
Being venture scale is a goal. But less important.
