***Interviewing CS students and bigco C-Level Execs***


# Interviewed Sam Schuchman
I spoke to Sam Schuchman who is a CS student at Brown. No recording. Maybe I screwed this up after all.

I completed this interview after doing the interview with Scott Brison. I felt that Scott invalidated a lot of what's in our investment thesis. So I asked Sam very different questions from past students.

First takeaway Sam values discovery
Sam doesn't know what he wants to do as a job. Gaining new skills and building contacts with potential employers are important to him. But he's also motivated by being able to learn about what he'd want to do as a job after university

Second takeaway Sam wants to learn about industries
This is also something which stood out to me when I spoke to Luke Briody which is why it stood out to me. Sam seems in many ways more interested in discovering which industry he'd like to work in. Than discovering what role he'd like to perform. Part of this is that he seemed to not be aware of available roles

Third takeaway Sam is open to opportunities which are available
When it came to internships, there was a clear dichotomy between what Sam wanted to pursue. And what Sam was pursuing. He seemed interested in startups but found an internship in a government agency. The reason seems to be that this is what was available

Fourth takeaway Sam is already doing proactive outreach to find opportunities
Sam reached out to +50 businesses to find an internship. This felt natural to him. But most businesses rejected him because they didn't have sufficient support for holding the hands of interns

Fifth takeaway Sam needs to be paid enough for day-to-day expenses
It seems his parents are OK with paying for tuition and rent. But he needs money for other expenses. I suspect this will be fairly typical

Sixth takeaway Sam wants mentorship
I proposed two options to Sam. Work on an interesting project independently OR do menial tasks for an experienced professional. He preferred the later option because he wanted to learn from someone who knows what they're doing

# Interviewed Scott Brison
I just spoke to Scott Brison who is Vice Chair at BMO. No recording. Think it got screwed up because we used his Teams.

The main takeaway was that the concern I had after speaking to Jen Beckey seems to be validated. Specifically, that the value prop for execs is too weak.

Scott was Treasury Secretary in the current government in Canada before joining BMO. Which means that he has experience working with a broad support team including a Chief of Staff and multiple assistants. If anyone in a Fortune 500 company would "get" the value prop. It would be Scott.

Scott has a full-time EA. But many of his peers share an admin who supports multiple execs. The way budget is allocated for admin support within BMO is that the EA's comp is considered to be part of the exec's comp when calculating bonuses. Essentially, the execs needs to produce A LOT of value for the org to justify paying for a full-time EA. Or be OK with risking their bonus.

One thing Scott said stood out to me. He feels that admin support is a "perquisite not a requisite". 

In my mind, Scott's perspective makes it harder to justify pursuing admin support as the demand-side value prop. And makes it even harder to justify doing this for big companies who are increasingly ROI-driven.

# Interviewed Luke Briody
I did an interview with Luke Briody who is a 2nd CS student at Brown. Recording here
https://app.fireflies.ai/view/Research-questions-Luke-Julien::gsW0zLNJ9i

It was interesting to discuss with Luke since his perspective was complementary to the perspective of Frank, the Princeton CS student I interviewed earlier this week. 

Frank is further along in his schooling and starting to think about what comes next. Frank is older and worked for 6 years before going to Princeton. Frank focused on his schooling and didn't pursue internships or other opportunities.

Luke is the opposite. He's younger (I assume 19) and too early in his schooling to seriously think about what comes next. He's a typical high performing student meaning that he is out networking, doing internships and talking to startups.

In many ways I feel that Luke may be an earlier version of Frank. He's eager to leverage his school's prestige, excited by the fact employers come to his school to recruit students, has a strong belief in the strength of his school's alumni network and is proud that he's exceptional enough to get admitted to an Ivy League school. I can imagine Frank thinking in this same manner 2 years earlier.

The most interesting part of my conversation with Luke was after I wrapped up the interview and discussed how I could help him. What I perceived was that Luke had started to feel rudderless and unsure of what next steps should look like for him.

I'd summarize my perception of Luke's unease as being something along the lines of
I was exceptional in high school which enabled me to get into Brown
At Brown, I'm still exceptional compared to my peers. I'm smarter and get better grades, more engaged and successful outside of the classroom and overall it's clear to me that I'm superior to almost everyone my age
But I'm starting to get a sense of unease as to what comes next. It's just now starting to occur to me that the things which I value in myself might not be valued by the people who can give me what I want next
If I had to summarize Luke's unease, it would be that his longstanding sense of being exceptional is somehow starting to slip through his fingers. And this manifests itself as rudderlessness covered up with bluster.

Another way of putting it
I know that I'm better than everyone. But I'm starting to wonder how much the people who matter to me agree

# Interviewed Diana Gibson
I did an interview with Diana Gibson who is a recently retired VP at Microsoft. Didn't record

Diana isn't one of our users/customers. What I wanted to understand from Diana are the employer-side mechanics which make it harder than Ivy League students expect to find prestigious jobs after school.

What I understood from Diana is that tier 1 businesses like Microsoft do have a tracked system which makes it easy for undergrads to get jobs. But that there are very few available spots, schools don't teach you what you need to access them and that people mostly get them via contacts.

The 3 ways to get a job at Microsoft out of college
Do an internship so as to get introduced to the business
-> they have very very few internships. And they only really do them when the division heads feel like it. Which is rare

Get hired before you graduate
-> they have a program where they'll hire folks while they're still studying and guarantee them a job upon graduation. There's a set number of spots. More than internships but still limited. And it includes a program to help folks integrate and learn about Microsoft

Apply for jobs
-> recent grads can apply for entry level positions and compete against all other candidates
The main way to access these opportunities is for a senior Microsoft employee to take the time to understand your strengths and weaknesses -> help you understand how to present/sell yourself -> then either hire you themselves if they have available headcount OR shop you around to others who they know you'd be a fit for.

The main ways to not access these opportunities is either for your CV to never get considered (first pass is done by a machine). Or to interview poorly. Both are solvable by having contacts who make sure you get an interview and who show you how to interview.

# Interviewed Frank Maranje
I spoke to Frank Maranje who is a CS and Mechanical Engineering major from Princeton. Here's the recording
https://app.fireflies.ai/view/Questions-Frank-Julien::DnDJDB2Tgi

I suspect Frank thinks about college in a different way than most students since he worked in the navy for 6 years before going to school. Not sure if his conclusions are different. He's also in his last year.

The main thing which stood out was that Frank went into college believing that graduating from Princeton would enable him to easily get a well paid job in an interesting city. And his primary frustration is that Princeton didn't deliver on this at all.
-> one element to learn about is at what stage of people's journey they discover this. It's something I felt with Jeremy too but he was in his last year of school when we met

The things which didn't matter to him as much were having an interesting job. Or any of the other fluff. I suspect even the students who think they care about those things. Don't care enough to let it drive their behavior.

Interestingly, the conversation we had after we finished the interview was the second most informative element. You can hear in the recording that we discuss me making intros to potential employers. I'm not sure if it's properly reflected in the audio version but Frank seemed suspicious.

This stuck out to me because I've gotten this impression from other undergrads. I suspect it has something to do with the fact undergrads are promised that alumni will help them if they get into a university. And that many people seem to be helpful. But actually aren't
-> we'll need to investigate further. I'm making lots of assumptions and drawing conclusions from other conversations I've had in the past

The final element which stuck out was that Frank felt that the track which seemed to work for other students was to play the internship game. AKA being a Princeton helps you get internships if you hustle. And those are the path to easily getting a good job.

This may or may not be how other students feel. I'm also curious as to when people start thinking this way. Clearly, Frank didn't believe this earlier. Otherwise he would have done tons of internships.
-> we'll need to investigate further. Dig into how students view internships more broadly

# Interviewed Jon Iwata
I had a successful call with Jon who was Chief Brand Officer at IBM. Here's the recording
https://app.fireflies.ai/view/Jon-Julien::8nTt86rkKx

What I heard from Jon which was most useful was that he faced 1 really big problem as an Exec: there's a limit on the number of decisions he can make in any given day

A good Chief of Staff is sophisticated enough to analyze complex situations to make V1 decisions. And knowledgeable enough about how Jon thinks/likes to do things that they can make useful V1 decisions. 

The value Jon gets from a Chief of Staff is that this person can remove some of the earlier-in-the-process decision making. Which enables Jon to make more decisions.

This highlights an important potential risk: can undergrads truly help with this?

No clue. Mostly because I don't understand the Chief of Staff's day-to-day. A way of finding out is to ask a Chief of Staff.

I've already scheduled a call for Friday with a guy who worked as Jon's Chief of Staff in the past. I also reached out to the Chief of Staff to the CEO of Publicis.

# Interviewed Seth Dobrin
I had a successful call with Seth who was Chief Data Officer at IBM. I didn't record this call but learned useful things.

FIRST When Execs think of recruiting people to support them. One of the considerations is that they want the person to have complimentary skills which they feel they lack. This is something I've encountered before and it impacts the
Potential product we'd build. We can add value for Fellows by helping them find Execs who need their skills. Adjusted the Notion (here)

Undergrads we should be targeting. I'm pretty sure the "Where you can’t easily get a job (Business, Economics)" category won't be the most compelling for Execs. It's most likely that CS majors would have a much easier time

Understanding of the problem for Execs. We'll need to dig in more when I speak to Jon Iwata but I suspect there are specific skills which Execs will have difficulty attracting to their personal team. I updated the Exec Problem Thesis (here) 

SECOND Getting approval for headcount is harder than getting approval for budget. The reason for this is that businesses don't want to be on the hook for paying people if there's a downturn. AKA headcount means they might need to do layoffs which they don't like. This impacts
Length of the Fellowship. I suspect we'll be more successful with 1 year renewable. Than with 2 years

The type of contract we'll want to sign with businesses. A SaaS model (what's in our current outline) will be the best fit since it'll feel less risky

THIRD There's existing budget for hiring early career professionals. This is the same budget they use for interns. This impacts
How much we can charge. We'll need to fit within that budget line item. I suspect it'll be something along the lines of $150k - $200k

People we interview. We'll need to gather more data on how much they can pay for early career professionals/interns
I didn't sense a tremendous pain point when talking to Seth which is a potential red flag. Then again, I didn't sense that this was super weird to him which is a good sign.
