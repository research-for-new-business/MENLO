# Risk 1: Engineering leaders don't want to hire junior developers at all
### How to derisk
- Talk to engineering leaders to understand why they hire junior developers and what challenges they face when hiring them
- Will be worthwhile to get a sense from bigco engineers and from engineers in smaller businesses

### When to derisk
- ASAP


# Risk 2: HR will be upset if we're enabling teams to make recruiting decisions without their input
### How to derisk
- Talk to engineering leaders to understand how they collaborate with HR
- Understand how getting approval for headcount comes into play AND understand how this works for interns
- Talk to university recruiters to understand how they see their role and understand their frustrations in working with hiring managers

### When to derisk
- After understanding whether we solve a problem at all


# Risk 3: Quality of Students will decline with scale which would make the business model non-viable
### How to mitigate
- Key is to recruit only the very best Students for as long as possible so we can get paid all the money we need from Businesses. $4k/mo is a great deal for top talent but a ripoff of randos
- We'll be able to go down market when our brand is strong enough to start charging Students
- Consistently recruiting only the very best Students will mean leaning on as many existing filtering mechanisms as possible. For example, tapping into Students from top universities or taking GPA into account
- Scale kills everything which we can counteract by creating sub-communities. For example, we can create a MENLO@Yale program and structure our platform to reinforce commitment to this sub-community

### Why it's worth taking
- There's a huge universe for us to recruit from and we can go global pretty naturally
- We can recruit from many different schools and we don't need to stay focused on software engineering as a career track


# Risk 4: CAC is too high for adding new Businesses to our markerplace
### How to mitigate
- Lean on Students to do lead gen and invest in great tools for them to reach out to Managers
- Create a rinse and repeat motion for signing properly structured MSAs which make it easy for future Managers to easily sign up

### Why it's worth taking
- It's worth taking IF Managers recruits with MENLO consistently after their first experience
- And if we quickly spread via word-of-mouth within a Business after signing a first MSA


# Risk 5: Can't justify a high enough take rate
### How to mitigate
- Challenge here is that Students and Businesses will feel it's a ripoff if we're taking too much of a big cut
- Also, we do need to support the Students and that costs money
- Part of the answer is to create secondary revenue streams like a recruiting marketplace
- The other part of the answer is to turn costs into revenue streams. For example, we shouldn't pay for courses which Students take. Instead, we should get Students to pay for them out of pocket and get a referral fee

### Why it's worth taking
- The market has evolved to enable extremely high cost education and we're charging $0 to Students
- There's a ton of room for us to capture value


# Risk 6: Too operations heavy, too many people involved and it's a pain to run
### How to mitigate
- Leverage existing service providers rather than do things ourselves. For example, we shouldn't have our own office space but rather sublet from a coworking space
- Create tools to make it easy for the 1:1 Coaches to keep Students accountable
- Create structures for Students to keep each other accountable via transparency and competition

### Why it's worth taking
- Businesses want us to be disintermediated since they want the Students to be part of their culture
- Businesses will also keep the Students under control via their existing structures so it doesn't fall on us all that much
- There's no need to get pulled into being hands on by fears of multi-tenanting because we perform mission critital roles which are scalable. For example, we provide secure computers for Students to work from. Or we enable Students to live in a low cost country without a work permit and without causing tax problems for Businesses by qualifying for education visas


# Risk 7: Students have unreasonable expectations of comp after graduation
### How to mitigate
- Avoid competing with expectations by get Students as early as possible in their journey. Before they start believing they're worth $150k/year out of college
- Don't try to give a competitive income at all. Only give a small allowance
- Leverage to our advantage by creating opportunities for Alumni to return to MENLO after they get a taste of the job market

### Why it's worth taking
- We don't need to compete if we lean into our mission of educating Students
