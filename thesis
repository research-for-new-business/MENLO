**ACADEMY lets Startups recruit the best junior talent for $3,000/month**

# Recruiting new people is way too hard for Startups
- It takes months of hard work and tens of thousands of dollars to recruit new people who may or may not work out
- When you recruit experienced professionals, they have too many bad habits to be useful
- When you recruit recent grads, they take too long to train and don't cost that much less

# Why now?
- Training young people to enter the workforce has been disfunctional and getting worse for a long time
- What changed is that elite schools are doing away with standardized testing
- This is creating a generation of top achievers who will be sidelined by established institutions and will be excited to join a more elite alternate track

# Go-to-market
- Students are the hard side of our marketplace and our go-to-market focus is on students
- We go to colleges which are known for having the highest SAT scores. Set up free coffee shops during finals and midterms near the freshman dorms. Then we sign up the freshmen so every time they refer someone who has a 99th percentile SAT score both them and their friend gets $5

# Sequencing
- Start with Students who have a 99th percentile SAT score. And have them work in Startups
- Expand beyond the SAT to other measurable markers of intelligence and performance. Starting with what's artificially undervalued such as AFQT scores or Mensa IQ tests
- Add global Startups and global Students
- Once we have sufficient brand recognition, we'll add larger employers starting with high paying industries like Tech, Healthcare, Finance, Real Estate
- The goal is to become a full-fledge and more prestigious alternative to eite universities. This will happen by making it compelling for Students to not return to university and by encouraging Students to apply before even starting college. It will mean adding humanities courses to offer a more well rounded education. And a hiring marketplace to make it easy for alumni to get jobs throughout their career
- Over time, we'll make it compelling for Students to stay in ACADEMY longer than the typical university education by offering higher paid tiers for more experienced people
