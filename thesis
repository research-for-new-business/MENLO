**MENLO lets Startups recruit the best junior talent for $3,000/month**

- It takes months of hard work and tens of thousands of dollars to recruit new people who may or may not work out
- Experienced professionals have too much going on outside of work to truly focus on a Startup's success
- Juniors take too long to train and need too much handholding to be useful to Startups

# Why now?
- Training young people to enter the workforce has been disfunctional and getting worse for a long time
- What changed is that elite institutions are doing away with standardized testing
- This has created a generation of top achievers who are looking for a way to signal to employers that they can become top contributors
