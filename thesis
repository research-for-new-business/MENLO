**Recruit the best junior developers half price without adding headcount**

# Students are less employable after university
- Students enter university eager to learn and eager to make an impact. They still have a lot to learn but would make amazing junior recruits for Employers
- But their enthusiasm is beaten out by the time Employers hire them. Not only are the juniors who Employers hire sour and jaded. But Employers also need to train them out of the bad habits they picked up in university

# Get the best Students to apprentice with your team
…starting with CS Students
- MENLO is a way for Employers to easily recruit the most promising junior developers, pay them exponentially less, train them up fast and cheap. Without committing to hiring them as FTEs until they’ve seen them in action
- CS Students take a leave from university to apprentice with a team of experienced developers
- They get support and coaching from MENLO which enables them to immediately perform and drive value for their Employer. While learning maximally fast during their apprenticeship
- MENLO is structured to fund the highest quality support and coaching. While charging Employers 50% less than the cost of hiring a recent grad as an FTE
- The result for Students is that they learn exponentially more and exponentially faster than in university. For free. And easily get a high paying job after

# Product
### The best junior developers
- MENLO is a source of CS Students from Stanford, Harvard, Yale and Princeton
- MENLO filters for the best Students from those schools via coding exercises and other tests

### For half the price
- Pay $4,000 per month for a full-time developer. This includes benefits, PTO, etc.
- The reason MENLO is cheaper is that the developers you hire relocate to low cost Medellin where they work for you remote
- MENLO Students work exclusively for you on a full-time basis. They work from a secure desktop computer in a secure MENLO-managed office

### Training is fast, cheap and easy
Your team uses MENLO’s tools to anonymously provide ratings of the Student’s work, give feedback and flag missing skills

- Students immediately improve and adapt to how your team works because MENLO provide them with with a 1:1 Coach who reviews ratings and feedback. This Coach helps the Student interpret and apply input
- Students quickly learn new skills. When your team flags missing skills, the Student learns them on their own time. MENLO provides courses on Saturdays and Sundays
- Learning and improvement happens on MENLO's platform where Students receive badges, compete against other Students from their university and compete as a group between universities

### Easily hire as FTEs when you’re ready
- You sign a month-by-month SaaS contract with MENLO and have no obligation to continue your collaboration if there’s no fit
- The Student on the other hand commits to working for you full-time for 1 year
- You can extend your collaboration via MENLO for as long as you want. Or hire them as an FTE whenever you want

### MENLO profiles
- Students, Coaches and the Managers who recruit MENLO Students each get a public MENLO profile which they keep even if they’re no longer involved with MENLO
- Each profile type is built for different use cases. For example, Students get profiles which resemble a portfolio and is enriched with social proof. While Managers get profiles which enable them to advertise jobs they’re hiring for and reviews from past employees
- There’s also basic social media functionality built in such as messaging, feeds and groups

# Go-to-market
### Students
- Build trust via relationships with influencers who have channels about their experience at Harvard, Yale, Stanford or Princeton AND about how to find jobs as software engineers
- Create awareness with a raffle to get 1:1 coaching from a FANG VP+ on how to apply for jobs and internships
- Drive signups by giving a referral bonus to club presidents when a Student they refer gets admitted
- Filter for quality with coding exercises, by getting applicants to livestream a debate on a controversial topic and by working with Students to recruit a Coach via cold outreach

### Businesses
- Build trust with Managers by inviting them onto the MENLO podcast to give career advice to Students, and by inviting CEOs of developer-centric startups onto the MENLO podcast
- Create awareness by setting up a coworking space at developer conferences where conference goers can take phone calls quietly. Then distribute flyers promoting the coworking outside the conference and slip them under doors of rooms in nearby hotels
- Drive signups by creating tools which enable Students to reach out to Managers and recruit them. Then by having Sales Reps who “close” the deal when there’s interest

# Sequencing
- We started by recruiting CS Students from elite US universities. And we match them up with software development jobs
- We’ll add universities one at a time starting with the most prestigious. And add jobs one at a time starting with software development-adjacent roles like product management. And starting with high paying industries like tech, finance, healthcare and real estate
- Creating a full fledged and more elite replacement to university will mean making it compelling for students to not return to university and instead stay with MENLO. Part of making this an obvious choice will be to create a hiring marketplace for MENLO Alumni. This would make it easier to find jobs throughout your career after having completed MENLO than after getting a university degree
- We’ll eventually need to add courses which aren’t strictly career-oriented before expecting Students to skip university altogether. For example, we could offer top philosophy courses
- Ultimately, the opportunity here isn’t about education at all but rather about changing how early careers work. This means there will eventually be a path to creating higher paying tiers which make it compelling for Students to stay in MENLO for a decade or longer

# Why now
- There’s a new generation of Students who grew up in a world where almost everyone agrees that university education costs way too much and doesn’t truly help much with getting jobs
- They still pursue university degrees because it’s the only available track. But get jaded and skeptical of the value within 1 or 2 semesters. And are actively seeking an alternate track
- On the Employer side, enough businesses are now remote friendly that it's possible to do a reverse-Infosys model and cut costs by offshoring top local talent
